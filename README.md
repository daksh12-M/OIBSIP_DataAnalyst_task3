# OIBSIP_DataScience_Task3

## 📌 Objective
The objective of this task was to perform **data cleaning and exploratory analysis** on two real-world datasets — Airbnb NYC 2019 and YouTube Trending Videos — to understand data quality issues and prepare the datasets for meaningful insights.

## 📂 Files in this Repository
- `four.ipynb` → Analysis of Airbnb NYC 2019 dataset (`AB_NYC_2019.csv`)  
- `5th.ipynb` → Analysis of YouTube Canada trending videos dataset (`CAvideos.csv`)  

## ⚙️ Steps Performed
### **Airbnb NYC Dataset**
1. Loaded dataset (`AB_NYC_2019.csv`).  
2. Checked dataset size, columns, and data types.  
3. Conducted basic exploratory analysis (distribution of listings, pricing, availability).  
4. Visualized patterns using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**.  

### **YouTube Trending Videos Dataset**
1. Loaded dataset (`CAvideos.csv`).  
2. Checked for missing values and handled them (e.g., filled missing descriptions).  
3. Removed duplicate records.  
4. Cleaned and prepared dataset for analysis.  

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- JSON (for category mapping in YouTube dataset, if extended)  

## 📊 Outcomes
- **Airbnb Dataset:**  
  - Dataset successfully loaded and explored.  
  - Ready for deeper analysis of trends in pricing, neighborhoods, and availability.  

- **YouTube Dataset:**  
  - Cleaned dataset (missing values filled, duplicates removed).  
  - Ready for trend analysis (e.g., most viewed categories, popular tags, publishing trends).
